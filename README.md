# Fizzbuzz pairing #

This is a pairing task I completed with my pair, Erin. 

## What we did over both branches ##

```
We completed the fizzbuzz kata on the master branch using TDD and Rspec to run tests. 
The main branch used the format seen below: 

fizzbuzz(3)
  
On completion, we decided to re-do the task using an alternative method of fizzbuz: 
  
3.fizzbuzz

This meant we had to change our fizzbuzz code and tests.
```
